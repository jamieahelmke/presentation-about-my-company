## 4. About my tasks

My permanent job is to maintain our workplace: printer repair, sorting delivery bills, patching network sockets, setting up and maintaining our workstations. But sometimes i don't have routine: I have to repair phones, special devices, testing and mounting cameras, and much more. 



When that's done, which it usually is, I often keep myself busy. I deal with free unixoid operating systems like GNU/Linux based OSs or the less known BSDs. In general, I am fascinated by the topic of "Free and Open Source Software". The advantage of working with FOS software is that you can often learn and understand more than with their proprietary competitors. But free software is not always just an alternative; the web servers 'Apache' and 'nginx', for example, you use hundreds of times every day. They are the most widely used web servers of all time. You know the Text Editor 'Notepad++'? Also Open-Source. Or the GNU software OBS; do you know any screen capture software that is used even close that often?



I've gotten a little off topic: My activities.

Sometimes I get orders to write software myself. Software I have already written (or started writing) are our logon script, an online phonebook software and some exercises. I'm learning and getting better at writing software, and I'm also getting involved into the open source community. Therefore, all of my projects and presentations are under the MIT License in my GitHub Repository (github.com/jamieahelmke).
