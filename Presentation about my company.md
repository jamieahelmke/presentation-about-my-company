3.2 Our security arrangements

Access to the offices and server rooms is **only** via RFID cards. Due to this, we have a lot of electronic door locks, especially for very important areas of the company. Digital access is only granted if you have an "Active Directory Account". Direct access to the ERP system from outside is not possible.



3.3

As i said, we have an **ERP System** (Enterprise Resource Planning) which simply manages personnel and their resources, communication and  information.



But we also have an **CRM System** (Customer Relationship Management) which maintains the relationship with our customers and reveals a lot to them about production.



We have 2 server rooms at once due to space and fire protection. 



We have a class A Network in our company.



In 2018, fire broke out in one of the server rooms as a result of a defective UPS (USV). So check your UPS system regularly, always have surveillance cameras and at least one smoke detector in server rooms and don't put your UPS batteries in the same room as your servers! The smell of burning material can still be noticed today.
