## 3.2 Our security arrangements

Access to the offices and server rooms is **only** via RFID cards. Due to this, we have a lot of electronic door locks, especially for very important areas of the company. Digital access is only granted if you have an authorize "Active Directory Account" with enough rights. Direct access to the ERP system from outside is not possible.
