## 3.3 Out IT Infrastructure

As i said, we have an **ERP System** (Enterprise Resource Planning) which simply manages personnel and their resources, communication and  information.

But we also have an **CRM System** (Customer Relationship Management) which maintains the relationship with our customers and reveals a lot to them about production.

We have 2 server rooms at once due to space and fire protection. 

We have a class A Network in our company.

In 2018, fire broke out in one of the server rooms as a result of a defective UPS (USV). So check your UPS system regularly, always have surveillance cameras and at least one smoke detector in server rooms and don't put your UPS batteries in the same room as your servers! The smell of burning material can still be noticed today.
